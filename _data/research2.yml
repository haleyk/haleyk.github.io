  description: 'representational geometry, or the relationships among the firing patterns of a population of neurons across its inputs, shows important connections with complex human behavior. one key feature of a population's geometry is its dimensionality, defined as the number of unique axes required to fully specify the position of all the firing patterns of a population across all conditions of a given task. representational dimensionality has been shown to correlate with behavior in highly trained monkeys, but has not been systematically studied in humans. a major obstacle to bridging human and animal studies in this domain'
