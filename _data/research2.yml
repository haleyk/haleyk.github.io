- title: 'structure of cognitive control representations'
  description: >
    cognitive control is the brain's ability to flexibly guide thought and behavior.
    the human cognitive control system is especially flexible because any input stimulus
    can lead to any output behavior based on internally maintained goals, contexts, and rules.
    no other biological or technological systems yet developed can match the level of flexibility demonstrated in human behavior.
    and yet, we still do not have a complete mechanistic account of why control sometimes fails,
    in small ways when we can't multi-task infinitely, and in larger ways in psychiatric disorders like ocd.
    theories of cognitive control have proposed a "control representation" which is created and maintained during
    task completion and integrates necessary information to successfully guide behavior.
    in line with this theory, neural recordings in non-human primates suggest that both the content and structure
    of prefrontal cortext neural firing patterns correlate with successful and unsuccessful behavior.
    thus, parallel studies in humans exhibiting more complex, flexible behavior will enable improved
    characterization of control representations and their limitations.

- title: 'measuring representational geometry with fmri'
  description: >
    representational geometry, or the relationships among the firing patterns of a population of neurons across its inputs,
    shows important connections with complex human behavior. one key feature of a population's geometry is its dimensionality,
    defined as the number of unique axes required to fully specify the position of all the firing patterns of a population across
    all conditions of a given task. representational dimensionality has been shown to correlate with behavior in highly trained monkeys,
    but has not been systematically studied in humans. a major obstacle to bridging human and animal studies in this domain is that
    we presently lack techniques to estimate representational dimensionality non-invasively in humans, using methods like fmri and eeg.
    however, we have designed simulations which build from neural firing to modeling the fmri bold signal to test the strengths and
    limitations of various fmri designs for recovering dimensionality. factors like neural noise, correlated history effects
    of the bold signal, and task design all contribute to how accurately dimensionality can be recovered. we are using these simulations
    to design new estimation techniques and are currently applying them to human studies,
    which will enhance our understanding of controlled and automatic behavior.
