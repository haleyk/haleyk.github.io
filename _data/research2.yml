  description: 'representational geometry, or the relationships among the firing patterns of a population of neurons across its inputs,
  shows important connections with complex human behavior. one key feature of a population's geometry is its dimensionality,
  defined as the number of unique axes required to fully specify the position of all the firing patterns of a population across
  all conditions of a given task. representational dimensionality has been shown to correlate with behavior in highly trained monkeys,
  but has not been systematically studied in humans. a major obstacle to bridging human and animal studies in this domain is that we presently
  lack techniques to estimate representational dimensionality non-invasively in humans, using methods like fmri and eeg.
  however, we have designed simulations which build from neural firing to modeling the fmri bold signal to test the strengths and
  limitations of various fmri designs for recovering dimensionality. factors like fmri and neural noise, correlated history effects
  of the bold signal, and task design all contribute to how accurately dimensionality can be recovered. we will use these simulations to
  design new estimation techniques which can be applied to human studies, and enhance our understanding of how geometry in
  neural firing patterns contributes to controlled and automatic behavior.'
