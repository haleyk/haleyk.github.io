# - title: 'structure of cognitive control representations'
#   description: >
#     cognitive control is our brain's ability to flexibly guide thought and behavior.
#     the human cognitive control system is especially flexible because any input stimulus
#     can lead to any output behavior based on internally maintained goals, contexts, and rules.
#     no other biological or technological systems yet developed can match the level of flexibility demonstrated in human behavior.
#     and yet, we still do not have a complete mechanistic account of why control sometimes fails,
#     in small ways when we can't multi-task infinitely, and in larger ways in psychiatric disorders like ocd.
#     theories of cognitive control have proposed a "control representation" which is created and maintained during
#     task completion and integrates necessary information to successfully guide behavior.
#     in line with this theory, neural recordings in non-human primates suggest that both the content and structure
#     of prefrontal cortext neural firing patterns correlate with successful and unsuccessful behavior.
#     thus, parallel studies in humans exhibiting more complex, flexible behavior will enable improved
#     characterization of control representations and their limitations.

# - title: 'measuring representational geometry with fmri'
#   description: >
#     representational geometry, or the relationships among the firing patterns of a population of neurons across its inputs,
#     shows important connections with complex human behavior. one key feature of a population's geometry is its dimensionality,
#     defined as the number of unique axes required to fully specify the position of all the firing patterns of a population across
#     all conditions of a given task. representational dimensionality has been shown to correlate with behavior in highly trained monkeys,
#     but has not been systematically studied in humans. a major obstacle to bridging human and animal studies in this domain is that
#     we presently lack techniques to estimate representational dimensionality non-invasively in humans, using methods like fmri and eeg.
#     however, we have designed simulations which build from neural firing to modeling the fmri bold signal to test the strengths and
#     limitations of various fmri designs for recovering dimensionality. factors like neural noise, correlated history effects
#     of the bold signal, and task design all contribute to how accurately dimensionality can be recovered. we are using these simulations
#     to design new estimation techniques and are currently applying them to human studies,
#     which will enhance our understanding of controlled and automatic behavior.
