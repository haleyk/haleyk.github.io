I don't have to agree with an author to like their book but in this case I didn't feel like they were doing anything to persuade me to their side, and these are really interesting and important debates I do want to hear more educated opinions on which is why it let me down a bit. really excited to talk about these topics with our reading group exactly because I want more of the gray areas and to flesh things out more.<br/><br/>* actually downgrading my 4 star to 3 star simply because in all of the research done, ""intelligence"" and ""IQ"" were taken as real things and NONE of the issues with them were even mentioned, which was a HUGE miss especially for a book on the problems of race science.
