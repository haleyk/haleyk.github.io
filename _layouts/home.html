    <h3 class="fw-bold">about me</h3>
    hello! I'm <b>Haley</b>, and I study how the human brain effectively organizes information for complex, controlled behavior.
    my research applies my background in computer science to pressing psychological questions.
    I am very interested in how biological and articial neural networks represent data in service of flexible action configuration, 
    and I use fMRI to study human neural activity (see my brain to the right!).
    currently, I am a PhD candidate in cognitive science at Brown University advised by <a href=https://sites.brown.edu/badrelab>David Badre</a>. 
    previously, I studied computer science and cognitive science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I conducted research with 
    <a href=https://bungelab.berkeley.edu>Silvia Bunge</a> and 
    <a href=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~acollins>Anne Collins</a>.
    <br><br>
    outside of the lab, I am passionate about teaching, especially teaching that emphasizes inclusivity and student agency in the learning process.
    my courses have crossed disciplines and age groups, and I am always looking to advance my skills to best serve my students.
    I work with Brown's 
    <a href=http://brown.edu/sheridan>Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning</a>
    and the national <a href=https://cirtl.net>Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning</a>
    in pursuit of pedagogical improvement.
